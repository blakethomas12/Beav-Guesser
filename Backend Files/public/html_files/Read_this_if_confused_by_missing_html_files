!ALL WEB PAGES WILL BE GENERATED DYNAMICALLY BY WITH HANDLEBARS SO THERE SHOULD BE NO HTML FILES HERE!

In order to test the site, you will need to run it and then connect to a local instance of it in your web browser

Step 1:
    Make sure node.js and express handlebars are installed on your computer

Step 2:
    In your computer's terminal run "node server.js"
        (This doesn't seem to work for me if used in the visual studio terminal, so if you have issues try opening a new terminal directly from your pc)

Step 3: 
    Then in a web browser, connect to "http://localhost:4000/".
    Leave the terminal running.

Step 4:
    When you are done, input Ctrl + C to the terminal to close the local server.
    Closing the terminal should also stop the server if Ctrl + C doesn't work.


Still have problems or questions? Reach out to me via a discord dm (Tacn0). I'm glad to help!
